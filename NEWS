uncompyle6 2.8.3 2016-09-11 live from NYC!

NOTE: this is possibly the last release before a major reworking of
control-flow structure detection is done.

- Lots of bug fixes in decompilation:
  * 3.0 .. 3.4 whileTrue bug
  * 3.x function declaration deparsing:
    . 3.0 .. 3.2 *args processing
    . 3.0 .. 3.2 call name and kwargs bug
    . 3.0 .. getting parameter of *
    . 3.0 .. handling varible number of args
    . 3.0 .. "if" structure bugs
  * 3.5+ if/else bugs
  * 2.2-2.6 bugs
    . try/except control flow
    . a == b == c -like detection
    . generator detection
    . "while .. and" statement bugs
    . handle "except <cond>, <var>"
    . use older raise format in 2.x

- Add --weak-verify option on test_pyenvlib and test_pythonlib. This
  catches more bugs more easily
