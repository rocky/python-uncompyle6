uncompyle6 3.2.0 2018-05-19 Rocket Scientist

- Add rudimentary 1.4 support (still a bit buggy)
- add --tree+ option to show formatting rule, when it is constant
- Python 2.7.15candidate1 support (via xdis)
- bug fixes, especially for 3.7 (but 2.7 and 3.6 and others as well)

uncompyle6 3.1.3 2018-04-16

- Add some Python 3.7 rules, such as for handling LOAD_METHOD (not complete)
- Fix some fragment bugs
- small doc changes

uncompyle6 3.1.2 2018-04-08 Eastern Orthodox Easter

- Python 3.x subclass and call parsing fixes
- Allow/note running on Python 3.1
- improve 3.5+ BUILD_MAP_UNPACK
- DRY instruction building code between 2.x and 3.x
- expand testing

uncompyle6 3.1.1 2018-04-01 Easter April Fool's

Jesus on Friday's New York Times puzzle: "I'm stuck on 2A"

- fill out 3.5+ BUILD_MAP_UNPACK (more work is needed)
- fill out 3.4+ CALL_FUNCTION_... (more work is needed)
- fill out 3.5 MAKE_FUNCTION  (more work is needed)
- reduce 3.5, 3.6 control-flow bugs
- reduce ambiguity in rules that lead to long (exponential?) parses
- limit/isolate some 2.6/2.7,3.x grammar rules
- more runtime testing of decompiled code
- more removal of parenthesis around calls via setting precidence

uncompyle6 3.1.0 2018-03-21 Equinox

- Add code_deparse_with_offset() fragment function.
- Correct paramenter call fragment deparse_code()
- Lots of 3.6, 3.x, and 2.7 bug fixes
  About 5% of 3.6 fail parsing now. But
  semantics still needs much to be desired.

uncompyle6 3.0.1 2018-02-17

- All Python 2.6.9 standard library files weakly verify
- Many 3.6 fixes. 84% of the first 200 standard library files weakly compile.
  One more big push is needed to get the remaining to compile
- Many decompilation fixes for other Python versions
- Add more to the test framework
- And more add tests target previous existing bugs more completely
- sync recent license changes in metadata

uncompyle6 3.0.0 2018-02-17

- deparse_code() and lookalikes from the various semantic actions are
  now deprecated. Instead use new API code_deparse() which makes the
  version optional and bundles debug options into a dictionary.
- License changed to GPL3.
- Many Python 3.6 fixes, especially around handling EXTENDED_ARGS
  Due to the reduction in operand size for JUMP's there are many
  more EXTENDED_ARGS instructions which can be the targets
  of jumps, and messes up the peephole-like analysis that is
  done for control flow since we don't have something better in place.
- Code has been reorganized to be more instruction nametuple based where it
  has been more bytecode array based. There was and still is code that had
  had magic numbers to advance instructions or to pick out operands.
- Bug fixes in numerous other Python versions
- Instruction display improved
- Keep global statements in fixed order (from wangym5106)

A bit more work is still needed for 3.6 especially in the area of
function calls and definitions.

uncompyle6 2.13.3 2017-11-13

Overall: better 3.6 decompiling and some much needed code refactoring and cleanup


- Start noting names in for template-action names; these are
  used to check/assert we have the right node type
- Simplify <import_from> rule
- Pypy 5.80-beta testing tolerance
- Start to clean up instruction mangling phase by using 3.6-style instructions
  rather trying to parse the bytecode array. This largely been done in for versions 3.x;
  3.0 custom mangling code has been reduced;
  some 2.x conversion has been done, but more is desired. This make it possible to...
- Handle EXTENDED_ARGS better. While relevant to all Python versions it is most noticeable in
  version 3.6+ where in switching to wordcodes the size of operands has been reduced from 2**16
  to 2**8. JUMP instruction then often need EXTENDED_ARGS.
- Refactor find_jump_targets() with via working of of instructions rather the bytecode array.
- use --weak-verify more and additional fuzzing on verify()
- fragment parser now ignores errors in nested function definitions; an parameter was
  added to assist here. Ignoring errors may be okay because the fragment parser often just needs,
  well, *fragments*.
- Distinguish RETURN_VALUE from RETURN_END_IF in exception bodies better in 3.6
- bug in 3.x language changes: import queue via import Queue
- reinstate some bytecode tests since decompiling has gotten better
- Revise how to report a bug

* some routines here moved to xdis. Use the xdis version
* README.rst: Link typo Name is trepan2 now not trepan
