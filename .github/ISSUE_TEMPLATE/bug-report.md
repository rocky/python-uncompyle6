name: Bug report
about: Tell us about uncompyle6 bugs

---

<!-- __Note:__ Have you read https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/blob/master/HOW-TO-REPORT-A-BUG.md ?

Please remove any of the optional sections if they are not applicable.

Prerequisites

* Make sure the bytecode you have can be disassembled with a
  disassembler.
* Don't put bytecode and corresponding source code on any service that
  requires registration to download.
* When you open a bug report there is no privacy. If the legitimacy of
  the activity is deemed suspicous, I may flag it as suspicious,
  making the issue even more easy to detect.

Bug reports that violate a prerequisite may be discarded.

Note that there are way more bug-fix requestors than there are bug
fixers. If you want you need more immediate, confidential or urgent
assistance

http://www.crazy-compilers.com/decompyle/ offers a byte-code
decompiler service for versions of Python up to 2.6.

Provide links to the Python bytecode. For example you can create a

can add that too.
